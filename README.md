# Temperature and Wind Speed Forecasting using Two Machine Learning Models

## Project Describtion

This project aims to build machine learing model that able to forcast the weather elements in Saudi Arabia. It helps to answer the following questions:

Predict the weather element (temp) for different cities in Saudi Arabia.

Use the available data to understand how is the weather is changing in Saudi Arabia.
