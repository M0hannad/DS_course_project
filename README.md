# Temperature and Wind Speed Forecasting using Two Machine Learning Models

## Project Describtion

The idea of the project aims to build machine learing model that able to forcast the weather elements in Saudi Arabia. The scope of work were focused into the follwing points:

- Predict temperature and pressure for different cities in Saudi Arabia.

- Use the available data to understand how is the weather is changing in Saudi Arabia.


## Dataset

The dataset contains a 249023 rows and 15 columns, and these columns are:

| Variable | Describtion      |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| City    | 13 major cities in Saudi Arabia |
| Date      | Record date in DD/MM/YY formats
| Time | Recored time in 24-Hour time format|
|Year||
|Month| |
|Day|  |
|Hour| |
|Minute|  |
|Weather| Weather description ( clear - sunny - .... )|  
|Temperature| Rerorded temprature in Â°C| 
|Wind| wind speed measured in kph| 
|Humidity| Percentage of humidity|
|Barometer| Atmospheric pressure in  hPa|
|Visibility| How far an object van be seen (in km)|


## Programming Laguage
Python

## Approach:
The steps taken to answer the research question listed above.

Sentiment Analysis
Topic Modeling

## Limitation:
- Limited Data Available.
- Time Limit
- Finding the best model to use.
## Future work:
- Include more cities
- Use the information to help estimate the potential for solar and wind energy in Saudi Arabia.
- Prediction for the rainfall as well.
- Using Time Series Analysis.


## Results:
MAE (Mean absolute error), and R-squared are used to Evaulate the model accuracy.
- Using Lineaar Regression:
