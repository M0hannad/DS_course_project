# Temperature and Wind Speed Forecasting using Two Machine Learning Models

## Project Describtion

The idea of the project aims to build machine learing model that able to forcast the weather elements in Saudi Arabia. The scope of work were limit to helps answering the following questions:

- Predict temperature and pressure for different cities in Saudi Arabia.

- Use the available data to understand how is the weather is changing in Saudi Arabia.
